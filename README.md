1. Simply open the application and you will see a list of customers and a search bar.
2. Either click on the desired customer, or you may search through the list by name, account number, phone number, or email. 
3. Once a customer is located, clicking on the customer will take you to a detailed view of the customer's information.
4. You may simply view the information and purchase history of a customer or freely edit the information fields making sure to save your changes if desired. 
5. If a customer needs to switch subscriptions from one vehicle to the next, it's as easy as adding a new active vehicle by including the make, model, and tag number in the edit fields. 
6. To add a new subscription vehicle, click on the blue plus symbol next to the active vehicle heading. 
7. Clicking on a subscribed vehicle will prompt you if you'd like to move that vehicle to inactive where it can then be deleted if desired.
